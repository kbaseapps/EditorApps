    <p>The <em>Set Editor</em> allows you to create and edit sets objects of the same type.</p>

    <h3>To use the Set Editor:</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Locate the app &quot;Set Editor&quot; in the App Panel</li>
    <li>Click the title of the Set Editor app to insert the app into your Narrative</li>
    <li>The Set editor will now be available from within your Narrative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Note:</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>You may move the editor cell up or down, or temporarily collapse it down when you are not using it.</li>
    <li>You may also remove it from your Narrative when you no longer need it -- any Sets created or modified by the editor will remain in your Narrative -- and simply add it back when you need it again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To create a new Set:</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Insert the Set editor as described above.</li>
    <li>If you wish to edit an existing Set in your Narrative, select it from the dropdown.</li>
    <li>The Set Editor will fetch the Set object and display the editor below</li>
    <li>An empty Set will have been created -- you should see it appear momentarily in the Data Panel</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To edit an existing Set</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Insert the Set editor as described above.</li>
    <li>Enter the name of the new Set. This will become the object name of the new Set, and so should adhere to the rules for workspace object names:

    <ul>
    <li>no spaces </li>
    <li>no non-alphanumeric characters other than _ and -</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Provide a description for the Set. (optional)</li>
    <li>To add a new Object entry

    <ul>
    <li>click the &quot;Add New&quot; button in the Items field</li>
    <li>select the Object from the dropdown list. Available reads objects must already be listed in your Data Panel.</li>
    <li>Provide a descriptive label for the Object. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>To remove a Object from your set, simply click the X button on the right hand side of it.</li>
    <li>When you are finished, click the Save button at the bottom of the editor. The Set editor does not automatically save your changes</li>
    <li>To confirm your changes, you may observe that the version number and save date has updated in the Data Panel.</li>
    </ul>
